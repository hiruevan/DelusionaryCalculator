Delusionary Math: Outside The Fence

A Mathematical Discourse Online Calculator

This is a calculator that utilizes the new Mathematical theory of the Delusionary Constant, represented by d. Our goal is to prove you can divide by 0, that 0/0 is all real numbers (Also known as the true infinity), and to answer questions regarding things that seem broken (Like what d/d is).
In addition, we also wish to include as many easter egg inside jokes from our advanced math class as possible.
